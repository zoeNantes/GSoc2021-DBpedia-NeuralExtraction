Broadly speaking, *Girju 2002*[<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor-1) defined that causality refers to the way of knowing if one state of affairs causes another. In English, the causative constructions can be explicit or implicit.

- **Explicit** causation patterns contain relevant keywords like *cause, effect, causation relationship* ...  
- **Implicit** causative constructions involve inference based on semantic analysis and background knowledge, e.g. *disease-causing bacteria*
