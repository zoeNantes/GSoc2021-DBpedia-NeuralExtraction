Broadly speaking, *Girju 2002*[<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor-1) defined that causality refers to the way of knowing if one state of affairs causes another. In English, the causative constructions can be explicit or implicit.

- **Explicit** causation patterns contain relevant keywords like <font color="#660066">cause, effect, causation relationship </font><br />
- **Implicit** causative constructions involve inference based on semantic analysis and background knowledge, e.g. <font color="#660066">disease-causing bacteria </font><br />


# Different types of causal relations
## Explicit causative constructions
### Causal connectives								
#### Adverbial causal link
&emsp; <font color="#660066">for this reason; with the result that	</font><br />
#### Prepositional causal links
&emsp; <font color="#660066">because of, thanks to, due to </font><br />			
#### Subordination causal links							
##### Resultative conjunctions										
&emsp; e.g. The colonies came to realize they had to separate from England, <font color="#660066">so	</font><br />	they started the Revolutionary War.		
&emsp; <font color="#660066">because, as, since, for, so, so that	</font><br />				
##### Structural link		
&emsp; e.g. <font color="#660066">Being</font><br /> cloudy, the experiment was postponed.					
&emsp; non-finite ing-clause					
##### Correlative comparative construction						
&emsp; e.g. The traffic was so heavy <font color="#660066">that</font><br /> I couldnâ€™t arrive on time.					
#### Clause-integrated link							
&emsp; e.g. The new satellite was named ASUKA (flying birds). <font color="#660066">The reason was that</font><br /> the migratory bird soaring into deep space.							
&emsp; e.g. It is not a myth that world hunger <font color="#660066">is due to</font><br /> scarcity of food.					




causation verbs								
	lexical decomposition (Nedjalkov and Silnickij 196) -- less used							
		Simple causative 						
			cause, lead to, bring about, generate, make, force, allow					
		Resultative causatives						
			kill, melt, dry, break, drop					
		Instrumental causatives						
			poison (killing by poi- soning), hang, punch, clean					
	verbal causative constructions							
		Analytic causatives						
			a verb per se, with a different, but often related, meaning.					
			"I made him do the homework." "I got him to do the homework."  "I had him do the homework."					
		Morphological causatives						
			suffixes -en and -ifll form morphological causatives,					
			blacken, sweeten, thicken, nullify, liquefy, verify					
		lexical causatives						
			appear to be in a direct semantic relationship with other verbs,					
			kill, feed, die, eat					
	Conditionals							
		e.g. If s1, then s2						
	Causative adverbs and adjectives (Cresswell 1981)							
		Adverbs of perception (audibly, visibly)						
		Adverbs marginally perceptual (manilestly, publicly, conspicuously)						
		Adverbs that involve the notion of a result whose properties are context dependent (successfully, plausibly, conveniently, amusingly, pleasantly)						
		Adverbs that suggest tendencies, liabilities, disposition or potencies (irrevocably, ously, rudely)						
		Adverbs that refer to effects (obediently, gratefully, consequently, painfully) 						
		Adverbs of means (mechanically, magically)
